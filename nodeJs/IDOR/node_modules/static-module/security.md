# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Only the latest major version is supported at any given time.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
To report a security vulnerability, please use the
[Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security).
Tidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure.

Note that this module is intended for build-time transforms on
trusted code. As such, if a security fix requires changes that
would make the module significantly less powerful, we may prefer
the unsafety.
