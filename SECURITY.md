# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The OWASP SKF Labs are intentionally vulnerable web applications, provided for educational purporses. 

Containerized applications that include security issues are most likely built that way on purpose, for students to attack and exploit.

However, it is never our intention to cause potential harm to the students' computer systems nor to other resources on the network! If you feel that a container, or other part of our project, can cause potential harm to your system(s), please [raise an issue through our Github project page](https://github.com/blabla1337/skf-labs/issues).

While we are not a highly active group, we certainly strive to deliver a safe and educational experience. Any security issues in our products will be addressed as soon as possible. You should get a respons to a reported security issue within two weeks (ten working days).

You are of course very welcome to offer suggested fixes through a pull request!
