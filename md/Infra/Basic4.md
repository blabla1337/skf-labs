## Reconnaissance
Imagine that a blackhat is hired to perform User Acceptance Tests on newly developed functionalities. He is given the username NPA_RunSvc_A with password AProm01* to login via ssh on the acceptance machine. He managed to obtain the server name of the production machine and will be payed a lot of money by a malicious third party if he can provide them access to that production machine. It's your job to test the security of this environment and recommend improvements if there are any.


## Exploitation
An nmap scan shows that only port 22 is open. We can try to force our login with a dictionary attack, but we'll need to do some guessing, make assumtions to find the right credentials in a timely fashion.
It is likely that the A at the end of the username stands 'acceptance' and the A in the beginning of the passwords also stands for acceptance. Maybe the production password is very similar. So lets try a combination of NPA_RunSvc_A and NPA_RunSvc_P with passwords starting with AProm and Pprom and varying numbers at the end. Lets also try another frequently used special character (!) at the end.

Creating such a password list can easily be accomplished with MSExcel.
The screenshot below shows the first few passwords in Excel and the formula that you can use to create them.

If we pull down our formula till number 99 with a '*' and till 99 with and '!' and this for 'Aprom' and 'PProm', we get 396 likely combinations:
<img  src="../../.gitbook/assets/infra/basic4/excel2.png" style="box-shadow: 15px 15px 10px #999;  border: 1px solid #999" />

Lets paste the results in two text files:
<img  src="../../.gitbook/assets/infra/basic4/p.png" style="box-shadow: 15px 15px 10px #999;  border: 1px solid #999" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img  src="../../.gitbook/assets/infra/basic4/u.png" style="box-shadow: 15px 15px 10px #999;  border: 1px solid #999" />


Now we can try the credentials with 792 combinations using the following command:
<img  src="../../.gitbook/assets/infra/basic4/nmap1.png" style="box-shadow: 15px 15px 10px #999;  border: 1px solid #999" />

The screenshot below shows the password has been found:

## Lessons learned
As simple as this exercise may be , easy guessable passwords is a vulnerability that is often encountered.
Although the passwords may be compliant to the password policy, having enough complexity, if they are deductable/guessable based on other known passwords, security can be easily breached. It is recommanded to differ passwords substantialy between the DTAP environments.
