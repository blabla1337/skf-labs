# Open Redirect

## Running the app on Docker

```
$ sudo docker pull blabla1337/owasp-skf-lab:java-url-redirection
```

```
$ sudo docker run -ti -p 127.0.0.1:5000:5000 blabla1337/owasp-skf-lab:java-url-redirection
```

Now that the app is running let's go hacking!
{% endhint %}

## Reconnaissance

### Step 1

The application shows that there is a new version of the website available somewhere, and a click on the button "Go to new website" will redirect you to it.

If we click on the button we will be redirected on the new page [http://localhost:5000/newsite](http://localhost:5000/newsite)

### Step 2

Intercepting the traffic generated by the application, we note that the redirection is performed using the following call

```
GET /redirect?newurl=newsite
```

That will generate a 302 Redirect response from the server.

Inspecting the source code, it's possible to see no input validation of _newurl_ query string parameter is in place.

```java
public String redirect(@RequestParam(name="newurl", required=true) String newurl, Model model) {
		return "redirect:"+newurl;
	}
```

## Exploitation

The exploitation is pretty straightforward. Replay the redirection request, but at this time change the value of _newurl_ into another URL.

_Original request_

```
http://0.0.0.0:5000/redirect?newurl=newsite
```

_Modified request_

```
http://0.0.0.0:5000/redirect?newurl=https://www.google.com
```

Using the payload above we will be able to successfully redirect a user to any website:
